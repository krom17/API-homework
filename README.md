# API-homework- due to unresolved Environmental issues, this assignment was submitted late. Kernel is dying unexpectedly resulting in pip installation and posting initial import commands where necessary. Content changed overtime, resulting in nan values.


The assignment was not difficult and fealt within the scope of the taught material. Due to Environmental issues, The notebook issued from the teaching stadd had to be regenerated manually to facilitate completion of said exercise. Hence, time consuming as a result but very educational and informative. Environmental issues are yet to be resolved but it has been noted that they stem from the use of a MAC m1 chip. Hope to resolve it soon.
